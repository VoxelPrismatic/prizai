## Possible command syntax
#### Syntax things
> `;]command_name {arg1} {defualt_arg=6} {?optional_arg} {arg4} {...} {finishing_argN} `
> `{?arg_name}` - `arg_name` is optional
> `{arg_name=value}` - `arg_name` has a default of `value`
>    Will be updated to `?arg_name` in the help description to prevent clutter
>    If it is relative to another argument, use `*arg_name*`
> `{arg_name}` - `arg_name` is required
> `{...} {arg_name N}` - An unknown amount of arguments, useful for calculations or choices
> `{arg_name...}` - The rest of the command will be treated as the same string
> `{arg_name:type}` - The type of the argument, use `num` or `string`
> `<attachment:type>` - The command requires an attachment of type, use `image`, `archive` or `document`
