#] PRIZM
=] THE CODE
>  Prizm is 100% open source and available for anybody to use
>  This bot is just a project I started in my spare time, and
>  now it has grown to something I would've never thought
>  would happen. Due to bad habits and things, this bot has
>  been rewritten twice already, and oh boy is it [not] fun!
-
=] THE AI
>  Version 1 of the AI just compared strings and actually
>  originated from a side project on the TI-84+CSE, which btw
>  is where I got all the bad habits
-
>  Version 2 of the AI uses custom Markov chains to generate
>  text, and it isn't very good
-
>  Version 3 of the AI will be using TensorFlow, which means
>  that it's an actual AI. I am not done with it but I assure
>  you that it will come... eventually
-
=] THE PC
>  This bot is being run on a laptop with only 8GB of ram
>  and it's using more than 100 files for commands and more
>  This is not meant to be a high demanding bot, but I'm
>  already sure that it's more than just a side project
-
=] OTHER STUFF
>  If you would like to invite me to your server, use ';]inv'
>  If you would like to join my support server, use ';]inv'
