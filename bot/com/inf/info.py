=] Thanks for wanting to learn how I work!
``````md
#] THE CODE
>  PRIZM is 100% open source and is hosted on GitHub.
>  There are over 100 commands as of writing this.
>  PRIZM is using a library called discord.py to interact
>  - with Discord, and this library sucks. So, I'm making
>  - my own. Therefore PRIZM is under a complete rewrite
>  - and not all of the commands will be formatted the
>  - same way.
``````md
=] THE AI
>  The AI uses NLTK and your responses to learn. If you
>  - want the bot to learn faster, you can use the ;]learn
>  - command and send a full 2 person conversation
``````md
#] THE PC
>  This bot is being run on a laptop with only 16GB of ram
>  and it's using more than 100 files for commands and more
>  This is not meant to be a high demanding bot, but I'm
>  already sure that it's more than just a side project
