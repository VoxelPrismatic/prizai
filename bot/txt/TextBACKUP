python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.
created by guido van rossum and first released in 1991, python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.
its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help programmers write clear, logical code for small and large-scale projects.
python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected.
it supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
python is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
python was conceived in the late 1980s as a successor to the abc language.
python 2.0, released 2000, introduced features like list comprehensions and a garbage collection system capable of collecting reference cycles.
python 3.0, released 2008, was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible, and much python 2 code does not run unmodified on python 3.
due to concern about the amount of code written for python 2, support for python 2.7 (the last release in the 2.x series) was extended to 2020.
language developer guido van rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project until july 2018 but now shares his leadership as a member of a five-person steering council.
python interpreters are available for many operating systems.
a global community of programmers develops and maintains cpython, an open source reference implementation.
a non-profit organization, the python software foundation, manages and directs resources for python and cpython development.
python was conceived in the late 1980s by guido van rossum at centrum wiskunde & informatica in the netherlands as a successor to the abc language, capable of exception handling and interfacing with the amoeba operating system. its implementation began in december 1989.van rossum continued as python's lead developer until july 12, 2018, when he announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as python's benevolent dictator for life, a title the python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief decision-maker.
in january, 2019, active python core developers elected brett cannon, nick coghlan, barry warsaw, carol willing and van rossum to a five-member "steering council" to lead the project.
python 2.0 was released on 16 october 2000 with many major new features, including a cycle-detecting garbage collector and support for unicode.
python 3.0 was released on 3 december 2008.
it was a major revision of the language that is not completely backward-compatible.
many of its major features were backported to python 2.6.x and 2.7.x version series.
releases of python 3 include the 2to3 utility, which automates (at least partially) the translation of python 2 code to python 3.
python 2.7's end-of-life date was initially set at 2015 then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to python 3.
in january 2017, google announced work on a python 2.7 to go transcompiler to improve performance under concurrent workloads.
hello
hi there
this is an amazing quote
that makes no sense
python uses duck typing and has typed objects but untyped variable names.
type constraints are not checked at compile time; rather, operations on an object may fail, signifying that the given object is not of a suitable type.
despite being dynamically typed, python is strongly typed, forbidding operations that are not well-defined (for example, adding a number to a string) rather than silently attempting to make sense of them.
python allows programmers to define their own types using classes, which are most often used for object-oriented programming.
new instances of classes are constructed by calling the class and the classes are instances of the metaclass, allowing metaprogramming and reflection.
before version 3.0, python had two kinds of classes: old-style and new-style.[79] the syntax of both styles is the same, the difference being whether the class object is inherited from, directly or indirectly (all new-style classes inherit from object and are instances of type).
in versions of python 2 from python 2.2 onwards, both kinds of classes can be used.
old-style classes were eliminated in python 3.0.
the long term plan is to support gradual typing and from python 3.5, the syntax of the language allows specifying static types but they are not checked in the default implementation, cpython.
an experimental optional static type checker named mypy supports compile-time type checking.
python's large standard library, commonly cited as one of its greatest strengths, provides tools suited to many tasks.
for internet-facing applications, many standard formats and protocols such as mime and http are supported.
it includes modules for creating graphical user interfaces, connecting to relational databases, generating pseudorandom numbers, arithmetic with arbitrary precision decimals, manipulating regular expressions, and unit testing.
as of march 2018, the python package index (pypi), the official repository for third-party python software, contains over 130,000 packages with a wide range of functionality.
as well as standard desktop integrated development environments, there are web browser-based ides; sagemath (intended for developing science and math-related python programs); pythonanywhere, a browser-based ide and hosting environment; and canopy ide, a commercial python ide emphasizing scientific computing.
more sentences will hopefully make you better at this
that still makes no sense uwu
can you please make more sense? i kinda need it
hello!
that still makes no sense
more sentences should make you better
nyeh!

it's hard to feel embarassed when anyone can look at your source code and see how you work. that's about as personal as anything can get, isn't it?
so your good i guess
yes. do you?
great answer
pa
how do you feel, fellow bot?
i am afraid
i am incapable of feeling shame.
what
e
nvm
he
that was a funny
