# NOTICE
These files are not necessary for PRIZM to run, but they do tell whether or not your CPU can run PRIZM.
If you have an AMD CPU with the Zen architecture [it is Zen based if it has Ryzen in the name], then you most likely have AVX support and do not need to check.
If you have an Intel CPU, please check the `avx` file. The others aren't needed now.
