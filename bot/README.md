# #] IMPORTANT - READ THIS
To install PRIZM with ease, please run go to the install folder in your console,
then run `./inst.sh`. Be aware that some features may not be present if you do
not run PRIZM on Ubuntu or one of Ubuntu's variants, and PRIZM only runs on linux
anyway.

The `./inst.sh` file is 100% automated except for some token things that it will
ask you for. It even downloads/copies files to other places when necessary, so
please, sit back and relax for about 15-30 minutes while the installer does its
work. [yes, the installer is 100% automatic and works for any version of linux
you use]

**NOTICE:** All GitHub integrations will not work out of the box
