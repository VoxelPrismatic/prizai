# Priz AI
My first ever bot! Priz AI
## How it works
It really isn't an AI
It actually is an RNG randomly choosing when to "learn" how you speak
The M2M module outputs the same thing given an input
## Dependencies
> I use linux, so the below commands are in linux format

| Module       | Paste this |
| ------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------- | 
| PY 3.7.x     | `sudo apt-get install python3.7` |
| DiscordPY RW | `python3.7 -m pip install -U discord.py` |
| Pip          | `apt install python3-pip` |
| AioFiles     | `python3.7 -m pip install -U aiofiles` |
| MatPlotLib   | [[LINK]](https://matplotlib.org/3.0.3/users/installing.html) |
| Numpy        | `python3.7 -m pip install -U numpy` |
| Numexpr      | `python3.7 -m pip install -U numexpr` |

> If you have issues installing, get `pip` first
> If you still have trouble, then idk whats happening
> because the same issue happened with me a while back
## File Names
> In order to ensure that this bot works properly, its best just to `git-clone` this repo.
If you don't want to, then just try downloading this repo as a zip.
If you *still* don't want to, then you have a problem.
