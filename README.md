## INSTALL
`pip install -Ur req.txt`

You must also install `ffmpeg` to actually play music

In order to use the `;]mix` command, you must also download [this file](https://mega.nz/#!9fh1iQzC!5d9zt6yKRbAXzgyxNMmoITua09b__zlU751KKOfpRSs)
and place it in the `mix` folder

^ is ~500mb

> If you have issues installing the requirements, get `pip` first
> If you still have trouble, then idk whats happening
> because the same issue happened with me a while back
